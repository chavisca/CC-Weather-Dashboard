# CC-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of using server-side APIs to borrow and utilize data.  
This project should create a web app titled Weather Dashboard that has a sideboard for city searches and a main section showing the current day data and a 5 day future forecast below.
This project was a great help in demonstrating iterations on fetch requests and dynamically populating elements with the data.

## Tests  
1.  Test form city search; city should add to search history and current/future conditions should display.  
2.  After searching, city name, date, weather conditions (icon), temp, humidity, and wind speed should display.  
3.  Future weather conditions should display a 5 day forecast with dates, icons of weather conditions, temps, wind speed, and humidity.  
4.  Clicking on cities saved to history should pull fresh search results for that city.
